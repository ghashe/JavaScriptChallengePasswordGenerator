##Description
It is one of the code refactor challenge assignments (CSS, JavaScript and Git) designed to prepare us for a scenario that we’re likely to encounter as a web developer and to earn a certificate as full stack web developer from University of Minnesota Boot Camp by the year 2022

I improved an existing site's CSS and JavaScript code to make it more accessible without changing what it does and hosting it on Github.
